Ansible AWX is a free and opensource front-end web application that provides a user interface to manage Ansible playbooks and inventories, as well as a REST API for Ansible. It is an open source version of Red Hat Ansible Tower.
In this post we will show you how to install Ansible AWX on Ubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu 20.04. In order to deploy AWX, it needs some Kubernetes Infrastructure like MicroK8s, K3s or Minikube. In this demo we will be using minikube ( A Single node Kubernetes cluster).
